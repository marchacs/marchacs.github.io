   <h1>Project 2 Proposal</h1>
	<p> My site is Greenily.co. Greenily is a blog run by Pam Mercer, my good family friend. She has a background in advertising and worked for many years at the National Zoo in Washington D.C.. Pam started this blog on social media and her own website to spread some of her knowledge on the environment and what the human population can do to help counteract the negative things that are happening. Some of my goals are to spruce up the site through more visual elements like graphics, non-stock images, and by making it more vibrant and exciting. When looking at this site, there are many fun facts and cool things that Pam has to share. As of right now the site is white, has basic typefaces, and not many things really stand out like the message she is trying to portray. The audience of this site is any adult, but my guess is the age range is anywhere from about 25-65. I say this range because this is specific to making family life greener. This would be used by mostly parents and couples with busy lives trying to make greener decisions.
