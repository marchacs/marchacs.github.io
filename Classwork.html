    <p> This semster for the most part we have been reviewing things from last semster but putting a twist on it or raising the level slightly.</p>

    <p>To start the semeseter we looked at our resmués. First we created HTML versions of our resumes. The next step in this process was to link this HTML Resumé to our index page which is currently my home/about page.</p>

    <p>One important step in all of this is that we used HTML and CSS Code validators to check for errors. This is a new and very important step that helps us all to recognize errors in our own code.</p>

    <p>Next, when reviewing CSS we began to style our resume using a style sheet and incorporating many things like google fonts. </p>

    <ul> Here are a few examples of the projects I have completed thus far in SMAD 307</ul>
