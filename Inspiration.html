    <h1> Inspiration</h1>
    <p>Here is where I would like to show some of my favorite products and websites that I explore frequently. A few things that I love when looking at design is things that are extremely sleek, vibrant, and simplistic by design. Many of these producsta and sites help me to dot the same. Before diving into websites and products that I enjoy, have worked on or use, I would like to share my classmate, Rachel's Site. <a href="rachelcmiller7.github.io" target="_blank">Click here to view her work.</a> </p>
