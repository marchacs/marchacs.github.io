        <h2>About Me: </h2>
        <p>Here is where I am going to tell you a little bit about me. I was Born in Washington DC in the same hospital as all of the women in my family. From there I lived in 5 states including Maryland, Texas, California, New Jersey, Delaware and 6 states if you choose to include my time at JMU. As you can Imagine, moving around the country this much impacted my life in so many ways and I believe this is the reason for my creativity, love of travel and desire to never settle down.  I am an adventurous girl and I hate being bored more than anything. </p>

        <p>At JMU I have participated in a sorority, currently am on the Ski and Snowboard Racing Team and most importantly I intern with the JMU Football team. My goal before leaving JMU is to fell fulfilled in every way and I truly believe that I will be able to do that given the things I currently do. I wish to pursue a career in sports media in some capacity and I plan on snowboarding for as long as I can handle it. Music has also taken a large part of my life and I never want to let that fade either.
        </p>
