        <h2>About Me: </h2>
        <p>Here is where I am going to tell you a little bit about me. I was Born in Washington DC in the same hospital as all of the women in my family. From there I lived in 5 states including Maryland, Texas, California, New Jersey, Delaware and 6 states if you choose to include my time at JMU.  As you can Imagine, moving around the country this much impacted my life in so many ways and I believe this is the reason for my creativity, love of travel and desire to never settle down.  I am an adventurous girl and I hate being bored more than anything. </p>

        <p>At JMU I have participated in a sorority, currently am on the Ski and Snowboard Racing Team and most importantly I intern with the JMU Football team. My goal before leaving JMU is to fell fulfilled in every way and I truly believe that I will be able to do that given the things I currently do. I wish to pursue a career in sports media in some capacity and I plan on snowboarding for as long as I can handle it. Music has also taken a large part of my life and I never want to let that fade either.
        </p>


    <h2> Current SMAD 307 Classwork </h2>
    <p> This semster for the most part we have been reviewing things from last semster but putting a twist on it or raising the level slightly.To start the semeseter we looked at our resumés. First we created HTML versions of our resumes. The next step in this process was to link this HTML Resumé to our index page which is currently my home/about page.</p>

    <p>One important step in all of this is that we used HTML and CSS Code validators to check for errors. This is a new and very important step that helps us all to recognize errors in our own code.</p>

    <p>Next, when reviewing CSS we began to style our resume using a style sheet and incorporating many things like google fonts. </p>
<h2> Examples</h2>
    <ul> Here are a few examples of the projects I have completed thus far in SMAD 307</ul>
